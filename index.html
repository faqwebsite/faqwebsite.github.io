<p> how long have you been playing video games? my whole life! even before i could play i would watch my sister play the gamecube, N64, dreamcast, etc. i started with cd-rom games at age 5/6 (spy fox, carmen sandiago, etc) and handhelds like the gameboy and DS, 
    moved onto web-based games from 6-9 years old(millsbery, neopets, club penguin), 
    then mmos (VMK, maplestory, and finally league)</p>
<p> skincare routine? 
    <ul>
        <li>wash with cerave daily moisturing face wash</li>
        <li>i dont dry my face at all, then spray with heritage rose water toner</li>
        <li>then apply my cerave daily moisturiszer to my soaking wet face</li>
        <li>i wait for this to dry, then add bioré japan aqua rich watery essence sunblock sunscreen</li>
    </ul>
</p>
    <p> hair care routine? 
    <ul>
        <li>i do an oil mask with MCT oil at least 2 hours before i wash my hair but sometimes leave it in overnight</li>
        <li>i wash my hair with bioderma cleansing oil. it's oil-based so it removes the oil well. technically it's a body/face wash but i find it removes all the oil from the mask without stripping my hair which is an issue i had with normal shampoos</li>
        <li>i condition my hair with "raw sugar moisturizer smoothie" and leave in for 5 minutes. i rinse my hair and wring out as much as water as possible</li>
        <li>then i add in briogeo "don't despair repair" conditioner (kind of expensive) conditioner and leave for a few minutes then scrunch my hair a few times with a microfiber towel. i leave the rest in my hair to style it</li>
        <li>i add a few drops of jojoba oil, diffuse my hair until dry and voila! all in all it takes me ~10 minutes to do my hair aside from the oil mask.</li>
    </ul>
